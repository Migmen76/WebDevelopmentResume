        <h3>The Dotted Line - Created with GoDaddy</h3>
        <p> I created this project for a local Real Estate Agent. He requested a website with his properties to be easily accessed.

        <h3>Project Name</h3>
        <h3>Coya's Artisenal Ice Cream - Created with Wordpress</h3>
        <p class="">
            One project that I throughly enjoy creating was for a family member in Fort Myers, Florida. My uncle Manuel, who owns a homemade 
            ice cream shop. He requested a webpage with all his products visible to his costumers. It was also required to be translated into English and 
            Spanish. A map location was added of the exact spot where his business resides. I also implemented a contact list where all messages would go
            directly to his email. Reviews from his customers  were added on his "Book an event" page and a link to his Social Media & Yelp. I added as well
            as a "contact form" and bright colors to complement the delicious colorful products.
